Second build of Missile Defender

I will be around for your 12pm class if you have any comments/questions

How to play:  
Double click on Missile Defender.exe
You need to prevent the enemy missiles from hitting your buildings
Use the left mouse button to target on the screen where you want missiles or explosions to intercept the enemy missiles

New features:
Multiple missile launchers that launch missiles depending on where you target the mouse
Added more buildings
Game duration lasts 30 seconds before the "turn" (day) ends and then goes into the buying screen
Buying screen that allows the player to increase missile and explosion abilities
When all Housing buildings are destroyed the amount of days the player lasted is displayed
For this build I will leave in the debugging information that will show in the middle of the screen so that professor will understand what is going on
Armageddon button added so that one can further test all buildings getting destroyed very fast - The timer will be set too high to allow for reaching the next day
Each building level is worth $50


Known issues to fix:
Player missiles do a circle if targetted too close to the launcher - Due to this missiles will self destruct within 5 seconds
Left and right launchers shoot missiles from outside of the spawn point
Buying for missile launchers and buildings is not working and UI isn't lining up depending upon player resolution
Missiles are not going in the right directions depending on which part of the screen it appears on (this worked before...)


TODO:
Networking (co-op) between two players (Just starting with Unity Networking as of last week)
Buttons for buy screen do not line up (find out about UI Scaling)
Assets for better looking buttons
Make game turns last longer after every day.
Find a better font for the game text
Make explosions disappear(destroy) before buying screen appears
Add "How To Play" to the main menu
Max levels for increases
Sound setup on main menu and in game - I consider this a part of polish
